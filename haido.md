I am Hai Do from Vietnam.
For past 14 years working as a cleaner, just started my coding journey about more than a year ago.
Mostly worked on my own but recently got a training job at Free.fi and got some experiences working in the team.
Excited to get to learn how to get better in communication with team and deepen my knowledge about JavaScript, TypeScript and Java as long as other related things as well.
