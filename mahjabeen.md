# Introduction
Hello, my name is Mahjabeen. You can call me Neela.
I made some mistakes today while doing this assignment.

### git pull origin upstream

This means I was trying to pull from my origin to the upstream.
Instead I should have written this:

 ### git pull upstream origin

 Never late to learn, right?
