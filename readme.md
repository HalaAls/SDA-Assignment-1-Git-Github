# Hi I am Md Touhidul Islam

## About me

I am a student of Software Engineering, Tampere Univesity of Applied Sciences, Finland. and I’m passionate about all things JavaScript and React. I work hard. I care about writing clean code and love to learn. I’m currently looking for the right opportunity to work in an environment that will help me progress into a full-stack role. My graduation is expected to take place in May of the following year. Because of my training and experience, I want to approach my work with more professionalism. Areas of interest for full-stack development. In the future, I want to work professionally as a full-stack developer. More projects and teams are also things I want to work on. I'm hoping for the assistance of your company.
